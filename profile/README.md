### 🎯 Use Case Examples



## 🚀 Quick Start

Get up and running with production vector search in minutes:

```bash
# Clone our production RAG stack
git clone https://github.com/vectorlabs-io/production-rag-stack
cd production-rag-stack

# Start with Docker Compose (local development)
docker-compose up -d

# Or deploy to Kubernetes (production)
helm repo add vectorlabs https://charts.vectorlabs.io
helm install my-rag-stack vectorlabs/production-rag

# Run example queries
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/search" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "What are the benefits of vector databases?", "limit": 5}'
```

## 🏛️ Architecture Principles
